# GeoAI Challenge Location Mention Recognition Solution

This repository contains my solution for the GeoAI Challenge Location Mention Recognition (LMR) from Social Media organized by ITU. The challenge focuses on extracting location mentions from microblogging posts during emergencies, which can be crucial for disaster response authorities. The goal is to develop an automated system that recognizes location mentions and assigns location types to them.
